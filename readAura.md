## Week challenge (Tuesday)
### Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
- In a simple way we can say that:

   An interpreted language is read line by line, can be cross-plataform, interpreter required and the source code is public.

   A program with compiled language can be run when the coding is completed, we can share the executable but depends on the platform that we used initially and the source code is private.

### Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
- Java is considered an hybrid language, that means both compiled and interpreted.
