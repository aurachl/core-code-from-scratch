`Learning about:` 💡
* **TypeScript Summary**
> **Quick Recap!**
>>TS is a programming language developed and maintained by `Microsoft` and it's consider a `superset of JavaScript`. So, what is the plus that TS brings to the table? A `robust type system` that mesh well with another technologies like `react and angular`.
>>
>>To understand better this language, you can always look at the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/) and test your code in real time at the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)


> **TypeScript vs. JavaScript**
>>Why choose TypeScript over JavaScript? One can say because of the really good features, beside the nice possibilities for `intellisense`, are the `classes, interfaces, modules`, the ease of implementing `AMD(Asynchronous Module Definition)`, and the possibility to use the `Visual Studio Typescript debugger` when invoked with IE.
>>
>>To summarize, if used as intended, Typescript can make JavaScript programming more `reliable, and easier`. It can increase the `productivity` of the JavaScript programmer significantly over the full `SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)`.

> **Why to use TypeScript?**
>>Type safety: Allows you to catch type errors at compile time, rather than runtime.
>>
>>Classes, interfaces and inheritance
>>
>>IDE experience: Provide features like predictive assitance and intellisense.
>>
>>Future proof
>>
>>Grow as you go

`Learning about:` 💡
* **OOP**
> **Quick Recap!**
>>Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a `programming paradigm` that relies on the concept of `classes and objects`. It is used to `structure` a software program into simple, reusable pieces of `code blueprints` (usually called `classes`), which are used to create individual instances of `objects`.
