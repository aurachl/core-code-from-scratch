`Learning about:` 💡
* **TypeScript Summary**
> **Quick Recap!**
>>TS is a programming language developed and maintained by `Microsoft` and it's consider a `superset of JavaScript`. So, what is the plus that TS brings to the table? A `robust type system` that mesh well with another technologies like `react and angular`.
>>
>>To understand better this language, you can always look at the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/) and test your code in real time at the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)


> **TypeScript vs. JavaScript**
>>Why choose TypeScript over JavaScript? One can say because of the really good features, beside the nice possibilities for `intellisense`, are the `classes, interfaces, modules`, the ease of implementing `AMD(Asynchronous Module Definition)`, and the possibility to use the `Visual Studio Typescript debugger` when invoked with IE.
>>
>>To summarize, if used as intended, Typescript can make JavaScript programming more `reliable, and easier`. It can increase the `productivity` of the JavaScript programmer significantly over the full `SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)`.

> **Why to use TypeScript?**
>>Type safety: Allows you to catch type errors at compile time, rather than runtime.
>>
>>Classes, interfaces and inheritance
>>
>>IDE experience: Provide features like predictive assitance and intellisense.
>>
>>Future proof
>>
>>Grow as you go

`Learning about:` 💡
* **OOP**
> **Quick Recap!**
>>Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a `programming paradigm` that relies on the concept of `classes and objects`. It is used to `structure` a software program into simple, reusable pieces of `code blueprints` (usually called `classes`), which are used to create individual instances of `objects`.

`Learning about:` 💡
* **S.O.L.I.D**
>**Summary**
>>It is a tool that includes `principles` with the main goal of `help developers` to `write better code`.
>>
>**Bases**
>>
>>Code easy of support
>>
>>Easy of change/modify
>>
>>Be very extensible

>**Principles**
>>**S**ingle Responsibility: Every class needs to have just one `'task'` or `'functionality'` on the program.
>>
>>**O**pen Closed: A software entity have to be `open to extension` but `closed to modification`, is one effective way of `protect` our code.
>>
>>**L**iskov Substitution: Any subclass object should be `substitutable` for the superclass object from which it is `derived`.
>>
>>**I**nterface Segregation: Separate with `small classes` that implement `specific functionality`.
>>
>>**D**ependency Inversion: The modules of `high level` have to depends on `abstract elements`.

`Learning about:` 💡
* **More about OPP**
>**Conclusion**
>
> Object-oriented programming simplifies the programming process for us. It has many values like reusability, efficiency, and maintenance of code. While it may initially be hard to understand OOPs concepts will be worth the effort. 

>**Advantages**
* A real-world idea can be demonstrated, as everything in OOP is treated as an object.
* As we use the concept of encapsulation, programs are easier to test and maintain.
* Faster development of code is done as we develop classes parallel instead of sequentially.
* OOP provides greater security due to data abstraction. The outside world cannot access the hidden data.
* Reusability can be achieved by using classes that have been already written.

>**Disadvantages**
* Designing a program with an OOP concept can be tricky.
* A programmer needs to plan beforehand for developing a program in OOP.
* The size of programs developed with OOP is bigger than those developed with a procedural approach.
* Since OOP programs are larger in size, the execution time for these programs is also more.
