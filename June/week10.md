### React / Node.JS ⚛️

>### Introduction 🚪
### Before we begin, here's a quick FAQ to introduce some key concepts:
* **What is Node.js?** *Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code.*
* **What is npm?** *The default package manager for Node.js is npm. A package manager makes it easier to publish and share Node.js source code libraries. The npm package manager simplifies library installation, updating, and uninstallation.*
* **What is React?** *React is a front-end framework for creating a user interface (UI).*
* **What is JSX?** *JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension typically used with React to describe UI elements. You must transpile JSX code to plain JavaScript before it can run in a browser.*
* **What is webpack?** *Webpack bundles JavaScript files so they can run in a browser, and can also transform or package other resources and assets. Webpack can specify a compiler, such as Babel or TypeScript, to transpile JSX or TypeScript code to plain JavaScript.*
