### React / Node.JS ⚛️

### Before we begin, here's a quick `FAQ` to introduce some key concepts 🚪
* **What is Node.js?** *Node.js is a `server-side` JavaScript `runtime environment` that executes `JavaScript` code.*
* **What is npm?** *The `default package manager` for Node.js is npm. A package manager makes it easier to `publish and share` Node.js source code libraries. The npm package manager simplifies library `installation, updating, and uninstallation`.*
* **What is React?** *React is a `front-end framework` for creating a `user interface` (UI).*
* **What is JSX?** *JSX is a JavaScript `syntax extension` typically used with React to `describe UI elements`. You must transpile `JSX code` to plain `JavaScript` before it can run in a `browser`.*
* **What is webpack?** *Webpack `bundles JavaScript files` so they can `run in a browser`, and can also transform or package other resources and assets. Webpack can specify a compiler, such as `Babel or TypeScript`, to transpile `JSX or TypeScript` code to plain `JavaScript`.*

>### Covering the basics 🧬

### What Is React (React js) & Why Is It So Popular? ⭐
React is a JavaScript `library` for building fast and interactive `user interfaces`. It was developed at `Facebook` in 2011 and currently it's the `most popular` JavaScript library for building user interfaces becoming an amazing tool that helps to expand job opportunities as a `front-end developer`.

React applications are `components`, a component is essentially a piece of the user interface so when building applications with react we build a bunch of `independent isolated and reusable components` and then compose them to build `complex user interfaces`.
